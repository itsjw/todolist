webpack-chunk-hash\n\nPlugin to replace a standard webpack chunk hashing with custom (md5) one.\n\n_Note: It's a clone of [webpack-md5-hash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-md5-hash) plugin, but without sorting provided chunks (unobtrusive),\nand using native crypto module (performance)._\n\n## Install\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-chunk-hash\n```\n\n## Example\n\nJust add this plugin as usual.\n\n```javascript\n\n// webpack.config.js\n\nvar WebpackChunkHash = require('webpack-chunk-hash');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',\n    chunkFilename: '[name].[chunkhash].js',\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new WebpackChunkHash({algorithm: 'md5'}) // 'md5' is default value\n  ]\n};\n\n```\n\n## Options\n\n```\n// a callback to add more content to the resulting hash\nadditionalHashContent: function(chunk) { return 'your additional content to hash'; } \n// which algorithm to use (https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_createhash_algorithm)\nalgorithm: 'md5'\n// which digest to use (https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_hash_digest_encoding)\ndigest:    'hex'\n```\n\n## License\n\nWebpackChunkHash plugin is released under the [MIT](License) license.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"cristian.lorenzo.martinez@gmail.com","name":"dogmatico"},{"email":"m@rkis.cc","name":"markis"},{"email":"iam@alexindigo.com","name":"alexindigo"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-10-06T21:06:03.135Z","created":"2016-11-09T01:55:53.576Z","0.1.0":"2016-11-09T01:55:53.576Z","0.2.0":"2016-11-09T03:35:30.777Z","0.3.0":"2016-11-13T06:40:17.502Z","0.4.0":"2017-02-06T17:27:22.624Z","0.5.0":"2017-10-06T21:06:03.135Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/alexindigo/webpack-chunk-hash#readme","keywords":["webpack","hash","plugin","md5"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+ssh://git@github.com/alexindigo/webpack-chunk-hash.git"},"author":{"name":"Alex
