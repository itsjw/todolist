Adjust Source-map Loader\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/adjust-sourcemap-loader.png)](http://github.com/bholloway/adjust-sourcemap-loader)\n\nWebpack loader that adjusts source maps.\n\nUse as a **loader** to debug source-maps or to adjust source-maps between other loaders.\n\nUse as a **module filename template** to ensure the final source-map are to your liking.\n\n## Usage : Loader\n\n``` javascript\nrequire('adjust-sourcemap?format=absolute!babel?sourceMap');\n```\n\n### Source maps required\n\nNote that **source maps** must be enabled on any preceding loader. In the above example we use `babel?sourceMap`.\n\n### Apply via webpack config\n\nIt is preferable to adjust your `webpack.config` so to avoid having to prefix every `require()` statement:\n\n``` javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test   : /\\.js/,\n        loaders: ['adjust-sourcemap?format=absolute', 'babel?sourceMap']\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Usage : Module filename template\n\nSpecifying a certain format as the final step in a loader chain will **not** influence the final source format that Webpack will output. Instead the format is determined by the **module filename template**.\n\nThere are limitations to the filename templating that Webpack provides. This package may also operate as a custom template function that will convert output source-map sources to the desired `format`.\n\nIn the following example we ensure project-relative source-map sources are output.\n\n```javascript\nvar templateFn = require('adjust-sourcemap-loader')\n  .moduleFilenameTemplate({\n    format: 'projectRelative'\n  });\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: {\n    ...\n    devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate        : templateFn,\n    devtoolFallbackModuleFilenameTemplate: templateFn\n  }\n};\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAs a loader, options may be set using [query parameters](https://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html#query-parameters) or by using [programmatic parameters](https://webpack.github.io/docs/how-to-write-a-loader.html#programmable-objects-as-query-option). Programmatic means the following in your `webpack.config`.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n   adjustSourcemapLoader: {\n      ...\n   }\n}\n```\n\nWhere `...` is a hash of any of the following options.\n\n* **`debug`** : `boolean|RegExp` May be used alone (boolean) or with a `RegExp` to match the resource(s) you are interested in debugging.\n\n* **`fail`** : `boolean` Implies an **Error** if a source-map source cannot be decoded.\n\n* **`format`** : `string` Optional output format for source-map `sources`. Must be the camel-case name of one of the available `codecs`. Omitting the format will result in **no change** and the outgoing source-map will match the incomming one.\n\n* **`root`** : `boolean` A boolean flag that indices that a `sourceRoot` path sould be included in the output map. This is contingent on a `format` being specified.\n\n* **`codecs`** : `Array.<{name:string, decode:function, encode:function, root:function}>` Optional Array of codecs. There are a number of built-in codecs available. If you specify you own codecs you will loose those that are built-in. However you can include them from the `codec/` directory.\n\nNote that **query** parameters take precedence over **programmatic** parameters.\n\n### Changing the format\n\nBuilt-in codecs that may be specified as a `format` include:\n\n* `absolute`\n* `outputRelative`\n* `projectRelative`\n* `webpackProtocol`\n* `sourceRelative` (works for loader only, **not** Module filename template)\n\n### Specifying codecs\n\nThere are additional built-in codecs that do not support encoding. These are still necessary to decode source-map sources. If you specify your own `options.codecs` then you should **also include the built-in codecs**. Otherwise you will find that some sources cannot be decoded.\n\nThe existing codecs may be found in `/codec`, or on the loader itself:\n\n```javascript\nvar inBuiltCodecs = require('adjust-sourcemap-loader').codecs,\n    myCodecs      = [\n      {\n        name  : 'foo',\n        decode: function(uri) {...},\n        encode: function(absolute) {...},\n        root  : function() {...}\n      },\n      ...\n    ];\n\nmodule.exports = {\n   adjustSourcemapLoader: {\n      codecs: inBuiltCodecs.concat(myCodecs)\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe codec **order is important**. Those that come first have precedence. Any codec that detects a distinct URI should be foremost so that illegal paths are not encountered by successive codecs.\n\n### Abstract codecs\n\nA codec that detects generated code and cannot `decode()` a URI to an absolute file path.\n\nInstead of implementing `encode()` or `root()` it should instead specify `abstract:true`. Its `decode()` function then may return `boolean` where it detects such generated sources.\n\nFor example, a built-in abstract codec will match the **Webpack bootstrap** code and ensure that its illegal source uri is not encountered by later coders.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe loader will receive a source map as its second parameter, so long as the preceding loader was using source-maps.\n\nThe exception is the **css-loader** where the source-map is in the content, which is **not currently supported** .\n\nThe source-map `sources` are parsed by applying **codec.decode()** functions until one of them returns an absolute path to a file that exists. The exception is abstract codecs, where the source with remain unchanged.\n\nIf a format is specified then the source-map `sources` are recreated by applying the **codec.encode()** function for the stated `format` and (where the `root` option is specified) the **codec.root()** function will set the source-map `sourceRoot`.\n\nIf a codec does not specify **codec.encode()** or **codec.root()** then it may **not** be used as the `format`.\n\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bholloway","email":"npm@bholloway.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-03-03T06:03:12.157Z","created":"2016-02-05T07:58:51.774Z","0.0.1":"2016-02-05T07:58:51.774Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-18T01:23:50.952Z","0.1.1":"2016-03-29T04:46:47.602Z","1.0.0":"2016-05-17T02:38:25.334Z","1.1.0":"2017-03-03T06:03:12.157Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bholloway/adjust-sourcemap-loader","keywords":["webpack","loader","source-map","sourcemap","sources","resolve","adjust"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/bholloway/adjust-sourcemap-loader.git"},"author":{"name":"bholloway"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bholloway/adjust-sourcemap-loader/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"readme.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"58b90720-34fd\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 03 Mar 2017 06:03:12 GMT","_cached":true}
