isNode = require('detect-node');\n\nif (isNode) {\n  console.log(\"Running under Node.JS\");\n} else {\n  alert(\"Hello from browser (or whatever not-a-node env)\");\n}\n```\n\nThe check is performed as:\n```js\nmodule.exports = false;\n\n// Only Node.JS has a process variable that is of [[Class]] process\ntry {\n module.exports = Object.prototype.toString.call(global.process) === '[object process]' \n} catch(e) {}\n\n```\n\nThanks to Ingvar Stepanyan for the initial idea. This check is both **the most reliable I could find** and it does not use `process` env directly, which would cause browserify to include it into the build.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"iliakan","email":"iliakan@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-09-15T12:06:07.042Z","created":"2014-07-31T10:20:21.252Z","1.0.0":"2014-07-31T10:20:21.252Z","2.0.0":"2014-07-31T10:30:55.255Z","2.0.1":"2014-07-31T10:34:58.862Z","2.0.2":"2014-07-31T10:36:39.833Z","2.0.3":"2014-08-01T16:28:40.851Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/iliakan/detect-node","keywords":["detect","node"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/iliakan/detect-node"},"author":{"name":"Ilya Kantor"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/iliakan/detect-node/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"Readme.md","users":{"xch":true,"i-erokhin":true,"cliff":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"59bbc22f-176e\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 12:06:07 GMT","_cached":true}
