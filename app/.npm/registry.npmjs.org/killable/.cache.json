This way, the server connection can be killed very\nfast.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n```\nnpm install killable\n```\n\nExample usage\n-------------\n\nUsing express:\n('server' in the example is just an ``http.server``, so other frameworks\nor pure Node should work just as well.)\n\n```javascript\nvar killable = require('killable');\n\nvar app = require('express')();\nvar server;\n\napp.route('/', function (req, res, next) {\n  res.send('Server is going down NOW!');\n\n  server.kill(function () {\n    //the server is down when this is called. That won't take long.\n  });\n});\n\nvar server = app.listen(8080);\nkillable(server);\n```\n\nAPI\n---\n\nThe ``killable`` module is callable. When you call it on a Node\n``http.Server`` object, it will add a ``server.kill()`` method on it. It\nreturns the server object.\n\n``server.kill([callback])`` closes all open sockets and calls\n``server.close()``, to which the ``callback`` is passed on.\n\nInspired by: http://stackoverflow.com/a/14636625\n","maintainers":[{"name":"commandoline","email":"marten@marten-de-vries.nl"}],"time":{"modified":"2014-12-18T16:27:46.796Z","created":"2014-12-18T16:27:46.796Z","1.0.0":"2014-12-18T16:27:46.796Z"},"keywords":["express","http","server","socket","kill","truncate","destroy","restart","shutdown","immeadiately"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/marten-de-vries/killable.git"},"author":{"name":"Marten de Vries"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/marten-de-vries/killable/issues"},"license":"ISC","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"54930082-b31\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 18 Dec 2014 16:27:46 GMT","_cached":true}
