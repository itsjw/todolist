Status][travis-image]][travis-url]\n[![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url]\n\n## Installation\n```\nnpm i clean-webpack-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n```js\nconst CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin')\n\n// webpack config\n{\n  plugins: [\n    new CleanWebpackPlugin(paths [, {options}])\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Example Webpack Config\nThis is a modified version of [WebPack's Plugin documentation](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/) that includes the Clean Plugin.\n\n```js\nconst CleanWebpackPlugin = require('clean-webpack-plugin'); //installed via npm\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin'); //installed via npm\nconst webpack = require('webpack'); //to access built-in plugins\nconst path = require('path');\n\n// the path(s) that should be cleaned\nlet pathsToClean = [\n  'dist',\n  'build'\n]\n\n// the clean options to use\nlet cleanOptions = {\n  root:     '/full/webpack/root/path',\n  exclude:  ['shared.js'],\n  verbose:  true,\n  dry:      false\n}\n\n// sample WebPack config\nconst webpackConfig = {\n  entry: './path/to/my/entry/file.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'my-first-webpack.bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(js|jsx)$/,\n        loader: 'babel-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new CleanWebpackPlugin(pathsToClean, cleanOptions),\n    new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin(),\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({template: './src/index.html'})\n  ]\n}\n\n```\n\n\n### Paths (Required)\nAn [array] of string paths to clean\n```js\n[\n  'dist',         // removes 'dist' folder\n  'build/*.*',    // removes all files in 'build' folder\n  'web/*.js'      // removes all JavaScript files in 'web' folder\n]\n```\n\n\n### Options and defaults (Optional)\n```js\n{\n  // Absolute path to your webpack root folder (paths appended to this)\n  // Default: root of your package\n  root: __dirname,\n\n  // Write logs to console.\n  verbose: true,\n  \n  // Use boolean \"true\" to test/emulate delete. (will not remove files).\n  // Default: false - remove files\n  dry: false,           \n\n  // If true, remove files on recompile. \n  // Default: false\n  watch: false,\n\n  // Instead of removing whole path recursively,\n  // remove all path's content with exclusion of provided immediate children.\n  // Good for not removing shared files from build directories.\n  exclude: [ 'files', 'to', 'ignore' ],\n\n  // allow the plugin to clean folders outside of the webpack root.\n  // Default: false - don't allow clean folder outside of the webpack root\n  allowExternal: false\n}\n```\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin.svg\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/github/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/badge.svg\n","maintainers":[{"email":"johnagan@gmail.com","name":"johnagan"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-12-01T10:44:09.305Z","created":"2015-04-06T00:21:54.478Z","0.1.0":"2015-04-06T00:21:54.478Z","0.1.1":"2015-04-06T00:25:03.453Z","0.1.2":"2015-04-06T06:27:21.213Z","0.1.3":"2015-05-07T14:09:52.089Z","0.1.4":"2015-10-30T23:43:24.033Z","0.1.5":"2015-12-06T14:15:41.529Z","0.1.6":"2016-01-08T17:35:37.465Z","0.1.7":"2016-01-27T18:29:35.658Z","0.1.8":"2016-02-02T16:04:57.981Z","0.1.9":"2016-04-27T05:54:55.617Z","0.1.10":"2016-07-18T14:38:39.171Z","0.1.11":"2016-10-02T12:34:40.349Z","0.1.12":"2016-10-09T02:03:36.387Z","0.1.13":"2016-10-10T00:32:37.624Z","0.1.14":"2016-11-03T17:21:42.591Z","0.1.15":"2017-01-06T18:30:22.119Z","0.1.16":"2017-03-15T03:49:41.319Z","0.1.17":"2017-09-26T16:31:32.901Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin","keywords":["webpack","plugin","clean","node"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"John Agan","email":"johnagan@gmail.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"jbgutierrez":true,"nelix":true,"ackhub":true,"poorboy1991":true,"scotchulous":true,"fadihania":true,"mbaer":true,"chrisz-b612":true,"monolithed":true,"wgao19":true,"hckhanh":true,"princetoad":true,"eshinn":true,"nice_body":true,"fabioper":true,"landy2014":true,"yikuo":true,"ayoola_moore":true,"estill01":true,"chalassa":true,"gurunate":true,"yeming":true,"nikunjchapadia":true,"akh-rman":true,"serge-nikitin":true,"luffy84217":true,"alexreg90":true,"alexreg":true,"flayks":true,"atikenny":true,"yong_a":true},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5a213279-6ffc\"","_lastModified":"Fri, 01 Dec 2017 10:44:09 GMT","_cached":true}
