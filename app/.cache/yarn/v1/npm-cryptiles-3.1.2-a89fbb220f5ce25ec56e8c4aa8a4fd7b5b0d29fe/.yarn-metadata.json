Takes a size argument for the length of the string.\n\n### `randomDigits(<Number> size)`\nReturns a cryptographically strong pseudo-random data string consisting of only numerical digits (0-9). Takes a size argument for the length of the string.\n\n### `fixedTimeComparison(<String> a, <String> b)`\nCompare two strings using fixed time algorithm (to prevent time-based analysis of MAC digest match). Returns `true` if the strings match, `false` if they differ.\n",
