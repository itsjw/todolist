However, the demands of maintaining such a complex project have outstripped our willingness and ability to do so effectively, as a quick glance at the issue tracker will tell you.\n\nIf you're a developer and you're looking for an alternative to Tether, check out [Popper.js](https://popper.js.org/). Its maintainers have put a ton of work into it, and it's constantly getting better.\n\nIf you're with an organization would like to take ownership of Tether, reach out to us! We'd be happy to see this project in the hands of a team that can give it the love it deserves.\n\n## Introduction\n\n[Tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) is a small, focused JavaScript library for defining and managing the position of user interface (UI) elements in relation to one another on a web page. It is a tool for web developers building features that require certain UI elements to be precisely positioned based on the location of another UI element.\n\nThere are often situations in UI development where elements need to be attached to other elements, but placing them right next to each other in the [DOM tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) can be problematic based on the context. For example, what happens if the element we’re attaching other elements to is fixed to the center of the screen? Or what if the element is inside a scrollable container? How can we prevent the attached element from being clipped as it disappears from view while a user is scrolling? Tether can solve all of these problems and more.\n\nSome common UI elements that have been built with Tether are [tooltips](http://github.hubspot.com/tooltip/docs/welcome), [select menus](http://github.hubspot.com/select/docs/welcome), [dropdown menus](http://github.hubspot.com/drop/docs/welcome), and [guided tours](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome). Tether is flexible and can be used to [solve](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/out-of-bounds/) [all](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/content-visible) [kinds](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/element-scroll) [of](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/enable-disable) interesting [problems](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/viewport); it ensures UI elements stay where they need to be, based on the various user interactions (click, scroll, etc) and layout contexts (fixed positioning, inside scrollable containers, etc).\n\nPlease have a look at the [documentation](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for a more detailed explanation of why you might need Tether for your next project.\n\n## What to Use Tether for and When to Use It\n\nTether is a small, focused JavaScript library. For those who might be new to JavaScript, a library is simply a JavaScript file (or files) that contain useful JavaScript code to help achieve tasks easier and faster. Since Tether is a JavaScript user interface (**UI**) library, it contains code to help you to manage the way your website or web app appears.\n\nTether’s goal to is to help you position your elements side-by-side when needed.\n\nLet’s say you’ve started working on your dream project&mdash;a fancy web app that’s sure to become the next big thing! An important feature of your new app is to allow users to comment on shared photos. However, due to limited vertical space and the overall layout of your new app, you’d like to display the comments **next** to the image, similar to how Instagram does it.\n\nYour HTML code might look something like this:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <img src=\"awesome-picture.jpg\" alt=\"Awesome Picture\" class=\"picture\">\n  <div class=\"comments\">\n    ...\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNow, you could achieve this with some CSS using its `position` property, but going this route can be problematic since many of `position`’s values take elements **out** of the natural DOM flow. For example, if you have an element at the bottom of your HTML document, using `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` might could move it all the way to the top of your website in the browser.\n\nNot only that, but you also have to make manual adjustments to ensure **other** elements aren’t negatively affected by the positioned elements. Not to mention, you probably want your comment box to be **responsive**, and look good across different device sizes. Coding a solution for this manually is a challenge all on its own.\n\n**Enter Tether!**\n\nAfter installing Tether and including it in your project, you can begin using it!\n\n1. In your JavaScript file, create a new instance (or constructor function) of the `Tether` object:\n\n    ```javascript\n    new Tether({});\n    ```\n\n2. Within the curly braces (`{}`) you can configure the library’s options. Tether’s extensive list of options can be found in the [Tether documentation](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/).\n\n    ```javascript\n    new Tether({\n      element: '.comments',\n      target: '.picture',\n      attachment: 'top right',\n      targetAttachment: 'top left'\n    });\n    ```\n\nNow you have a perfectly placed comment section to go with your awesome picture! It’ll even stay attached to the element when a user resizes their browser window.\n\nThere are tons of other useful features of Tether as well, instead of “comment boxes” you could also build:\n\n* Tooltips for useful hints and tricks,\n* Dropdown menus,\n* Autocomplete popups for forms,\n* and [more](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/list_of_examples/)!\n\n## Install\n\n__npm__\n```sh\n$ npm install tether\n```\n\n__bower__\n```sh\n$ bower install tether\n```\n\n__download__\n\nOr just download from the [releases](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether/releases).\n\n## Usage\nYou only need to include [tether.min.js](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether/blob/master/dist/js/tether.min.js) in your page:\n```\n<script src=\"path/to/dist/js/tether.min.js\"></script>\n```\nOr just use a CDN:\n```\n<script src=\"//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tether/1.4.3/js/tether.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe css files in the [dist/css](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether/tree/master/dist/css) folder are not required to get tether running.\n\nFor more details jump straight in to the detailed [Usage](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/#usage) page.\n\n[![Tether Docs](http://i.imgur.com/YCx8cLr.png)](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/#usage)\n\n[Demo & API Documentation](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe encourage contributions of all kinds.
