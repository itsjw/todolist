    "readme": "# shallow-clone [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/shallow-clone.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/shallow-clone)\n\n> Make a shallow clone of an object, array or primitive.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)\n\n```sh\n$ npm i shallow-clone --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar clone = require('shallow-clone');\n```\n\n## shallow clones arrays\n\nThe array itself is cloned, but not the elements of the array. So any objects in the array will still not be cloned (e.g. they will be the same object as in the orginal array).\n\n```js\nvar arr = [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\nvar foo = clone(arr);\n// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]\n\n// array is cloned\nassert.equal(actual === expected, false);\n\n// array elements are not\nassert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true\n```\n\n## returns primitives as-is\n\n```js\nclone(0)\n//=> 0\n\nclone('foo')\n//=> 'foo'\n```\n\n## shallow clone a regex\n\n```js\nclone(/foo/g)\n//=> /foo/g\n```\n\n## shallow clone an object\n\n```js\nclone({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 })\n//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }\n```\n\n## Related projects\n\n* [assign-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties of source objects to a destination object.\n* [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep): Recursively (deep) clone JavaScript native types, like Object, Array, RegExp, Date as well as primitives.\n* [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\n* [is-plain-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/is-plain-object): Returns true if an object was created by the `Object` constructor.\n* [mixin-object](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/mixin-object): Mixin the own and inherited properties of other objects onto the first object. Pass an… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/mixin-object)\n* [mixin-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/mixin-deep): Deeply mix the properties of objects into the first object. Like merge-deep, but doesn't clone.\n\n## Running tests\n\nInstall dev dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -d && npm test\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
