If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.\n\n## Attribution\n\nBased on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.\n\n## About\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](../../issues/new).\n\n### Building docs\n\n_(This project's readme.md is generated by [verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb-generate-readme), please don't edit the readme directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in the [.verb.md](.verb.md) readme template.)_\n\nTo generate the readme, run the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install -g verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme && verb\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nRunning and reviewing unit tests is a great way to get familiarized with a library and its API. You can install dependencies and run tests with the following command:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install && npm test\n```\n\n### Author\n\n**Jon Schlinkert**\n\n* [github/jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert)\n* [twitter/jonschlinkert](https://twitter.com/jonschlinkert)\n\n### License\n\nCopyright Â© 2017, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert).\nReleased under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n***\n\n_This file was generated by [verb-generate-readme](https://github.com/verbose/verb-generate-readme), v0.6.0, on May 19, 2017._",
