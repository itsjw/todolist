    "readme": "node-asn1 is a library for encoding and decoding ASN.1 datatypes in pure JS.\nCurrently BER encoding is supported; at some point I'll likely have to do DER.\n\n## Usage\n\nMostly, if you're *actually* needing to read and write ASN.1, you probably don't\nneed this readme to explain what and why.  If you have no idea what ASN.1 is,\nsee this: ftp://ftp.rsa.com/pub/pkcs/ascii/layman.asc\n\nThe source is pretty much self-explanatory, and has read/write methods for the\ncommon types out there.\n\n### Decoding\n\nThe following reads an ASN.1 sequence with a boolean.\n\n    var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;\n\n    var reader = new Ber.Reader(new Buffer([0x30, 0x03, 0x01, 0x01, 0xff]));\n\n    reader.readSequence();\n    console.log('Sequence len: ' + reader.length);\n    if (reader.peek() === Ber.Boolean)\n      console.log(reader.readBoolean());\n\n### Encoding\n\nThe following generates the same payload as above.\n\n    var Ber = require('asn1').Ber;\n\n    var writer = new Ber.Writer();\n\n    writer.startSequence();\n    writer.writeBoolean(true);\n    writer.endSequence();\n\n    console.log(writer.buffer);\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install asn1\n\n## License\n\nMIT.\n\n## Bugs\n\nSee <https://github.com/mcavage/node-asn1/issues>.\n",
